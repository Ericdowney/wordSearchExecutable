# Word Search Executable

This is the main executable package used to solve a word search grid.  This executable package uses the wordSearchFramework to solve the grid that is passed in via command line.  This package does not contain any tests because packages of type *executable* cannot have tests associated with them.  That is why I have separated out the framework from the executable.

## Instructions
---

To run the project:

```bash
swift run wordSearchExecutable WordSearchFile1.txt
swift run wordSearchExecutable WordSearchFile2.txt
```
